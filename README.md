# Jetpack Pro (WIP: Model-View-Intent) :construction_worker::hammer:

Basically it just a project to show Movie and TV Show from [MovieDb](https://developers.themoviedb.org) to fulfill Dicoding Task. 

## Tech
- AndroidX
- Kotlin
- RXJava
- Retrofit for network request
- Room
- Glide
- Mockito and Spek for unit testing
- Espresso for UI testing
- Dagger for DI

In this project I'm using MVVM - Clean Architecture. By implementing clean architecture, it will give us :  
- clean separation of concern; making your code easier to navigate and maintain
- easier to test the code

*Clean Architecture will not be appropriate for every project, so it is down to you to decide whether or not it fits your needs*

## How to use it?
- Clone this project using `git clone [url]`
- build the project by using `./gradlew clean :app:assembleDebug`
- You can run the Unit test by using `./gradlew clean test`


## SPOILER ALERT
I'm still working with **MVI Pattern**, so please checkout `mvi-branch`
